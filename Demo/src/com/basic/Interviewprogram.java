 * Given 2 sorted arrays Ar1 and Ar2 of size N each. Merge the given arrays and find the sum of the two middle elements of the merged array.

Input:

N = 5

Ar1[] = {1, 2, 4, 6, 10}

Ar2[] = {4, 5, 6, 9, 12}

Output: 17

Explanation: The merged array looks like

{1,4,5,6,8,9,10,90,92,95}. Sum of middle

elements is 17 (8 + 9).
